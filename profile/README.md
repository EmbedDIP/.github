# 📦 EmbedDIP

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for **EmbedDIP** — an open-source initiative for embedded digital image processing on microcontrollers and edge platforms.

🌐 **Website** (soon): [https://embeddip.github.io](https://embeddip.github.io)

---

## 🎯 Mission

**EmbedDIP** aims to bridge the gap between image processing and embedded systems by offering lightweight, efficient, and portable libraries for:

- Real-time image processing
- Microcontroller-compatible algorithms
- Cross-platform integration (STM32, ESP32, Arduino)
- PC-side tools for communication and visualization
